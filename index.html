            <p>he essence of Norway's appeal is remarkably simple: this is one of the most beautiful countries on earth.
                Impossibly steep-sided Norwegian fjords of extraordinary beauty cut gashes from a jagged coastline deep
                into the interior. Elsewhere, the mountainous terrain of Norway's interior resembles the ramparts of a
                natural fortress.</p>
        </h1>
    </div>
    <h3>Wherever you find yourself in Norway, these landscapes serve as a backdrop for some of Europe's
        prettiest villages. Here are the must-visit places on your trip to Norway.</h3>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. The Oslo region</h2>
        <p>A lot of things are cooking in the Norwegian capital, which was named European Green Capital 2019. A
            cutting-edge food scene, new and funky neighbourhoods, a fully-packed event calendar, and several <a href="#">
                brand-new
                museums and attractions</a> are just a few teasers of what you can expect. <br><br>

            Surrounded by the Oslofjord and deep forests, you can <b>easily combine urban city life with nature-based fun</b>
            like cycling, skiing at some of Norway's <a href="#">top ski resorts</a> and trips to nearby regions of <a href="#">Østfold</a> and
            <a href="#">Vestfold</a>, with charming towns such as <a href="#">Fredrikstad</a> and <a href="#">Tønsberg</a> dotted along the coast. About an hour's drive
            from Oslo lies Norway's new art destination <a href="#">Hadeland</a>, where you can visit the wonderful outdoor art park at
            Kistefos-Museet with the spectacular exhibition building The Twist. <br><br>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Tromsø and the land of the northern lights</h2>

            to go. <br><br>

            culture in towns like <a href="#">Karasjok</a> and Alta, and enter the northernmost point of Europe at the North Cape. In

            paradise. Go king crab fishing and dog sledging in <a href="#">Kirkenes</a> and <a href="#">Varanger</a>, where you also can spend a night

            kingdom of whales!) on Instagram. A hot tip is to visit these places outside of the summer season when the
            crowds are gone. <br><br>

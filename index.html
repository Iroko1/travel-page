            <p class="big-letter">T</p>
            <p>he essence of Norway's appeal is remarkably simple: this is one of the most beautiful countries on earth.
                Impossibly steep-sided Norwegian fjords of extraordinary beauty cut gashes from a jagged coastline deep
                into the interior. Elsewhere, the mountainous terrain of Norway's interior resembles the ramparts of a
                natural fortress.</p>
        </h1>
    </div>
    <h3>Wherever you find yourself in Norway, these landscapes serve as a backdrop for some of Europe's
        prettiest villages. Here are the must-visit places on your trip to Norway.</h3>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. The Oslo region</h2>
        <p>A lot of things are cooking in the Norwegian capital, which was named European Green Capital 2019. A
            cutting-edge food scene, new and funky neighbourhoods, a fully-packed event calendar, and several brand-new
            museums and attractions are just a few teasers of what you can expect. <br><br>

            Surrounded by the Oslofjord and deep forests, you can easily combine urban city life with nature-based fun
            like cycling, skiing at some of Norway's top ski resorts and trips to nearby regions of Østfold and
            Vestfold, with charming towns such as Fredrikstad and Tønsberg dotted along the coast. About an hour's drive
            from Oslo lies Norway's new art destination Hadeland, where you can visit the wonderful outdoor art park at
            Kistefos-Museet with the spectacular exhibition building The Twist. <br><br>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Tromsø and the land of the northern lights</h2>
        <p>The capital of the Arctic, Tromsø, is located right in the middle of Northern Norway. If your bucket list
            includes northern lights, whale watching, midnight sun, and epic nature adventures, this is where you want
            to go. <br><br>

            Enjoy superb conditions for ski touring, biking and hiking in the Lyngenfjord region, experience the Sami
            culture in towns like Karasjok and Alta, and enter the northernmost point of Europe at the North Cape. In

            crowds are gone. <br><br>
